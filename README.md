This fork contains two main additions to the base kRPC project:

* Integration for multi-beam LiDAR parts. The mod for the LiDAR parts is located [here](https://github.com/nullprofile/LaserDist).
* Integration for a modified DockingCamera mod part. The camera can be triggered from kRPC and an image in PNG format is received. The supported DockingCamera mod fork is located [here](https://github.com/nullprofile/DockingCam).

kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from scripts running outside of
the game, and comes with client libraries for many popular languages.
